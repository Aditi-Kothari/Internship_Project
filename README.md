Website built during my internship to met the client's requirement.

Link to the website i worked on during my internship - https://www.myfuniturestory.com/

The client needed a website for her small scale business which focuses on children's furniture design.
She needed proper theme,colors and designing for her website.
So,as a part of my work ,I worked on different pages of the website like blog section,about section,contact etc.
I also contributed one part of my work in seo auditing.
Tools and technologies used - Web technologies , WIX platform.
I am very glad that the website i worked, built and learnt from is working successfully and growing good.
I am grateful to the whole team @MarketingHues situated in Sydney, Australia for such friendly-learning enviornment and giving me this opportunity.
